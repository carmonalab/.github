## Cancer Systems Immunology lab

Working at the crossroads of data science, single-cell multi-omics, and cancer immunology,
our lab develops and applies computational methods to understand how our immune system responds to cancer and to identify 
new therapeutic targets and biomarkers. 

Our group is part of the [Department of Oncology](https://www.unil.ch/dof/carmona) and the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research of the University of Lausanne, 
and of the [Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics](https://www.sib.swiss/carmona-santiago)

We are located at the new [Agora Cancer Research Center](https://agora-cancer.ch/) in beautiful Lausanne, Switzerland
